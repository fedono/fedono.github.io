> 这里说在讲述过去的事情，所以所有的语态都是过去式

When he was ushered into the room he saw Mr. Eastman bending over a pile of papers at his desk. Presently, Mr. Eastman looked up, removed his glasses, and walked toward the architect and Mr. Adamson, saying: "Good morning, gentlemen, what can I do for you?"

> - When 用作开头，就能看清是一个表示时态的语句
> - saw sb doing sth 看见某人正在做某事

The architect introduced them, and then Mr. Adamson said: "While we've been waiting for you, Mr. Eastman, I've been admiring your office. I wouldn't mind working in a room like this myself. I'm in the interior-woodworking business, and I never saw a more beautiful office in all my life."

> - While we've been waiting  中的 have been doing 表示一直长期做某些事
>   - 后面接着有 I've been admiring your office 
> - couldn't mind working 
>   - If you say that you wouldn't mind something, you mean that you would quite like it.
>   - sb wouldn't mind sth/doing sth

George Eastman replied: "You remind me of something I had almost forgotten. It is beautiful, isn't it? I enjoyed it a great deal when it was first built. But I come down here now with a lot of other things on my mind and sometimes don't even see the room for weeks at a time."

> - You remind me of something I had almost forgotten
>   - remind 后面接事情的从句，其实就是中间省略了 that，所以可以查下什么时候可以中间省略掉 that 
> -  I enjoyed it a great deal when it was first built.
>   - when 后面接从句
> - But I come down here now with a lot of other things on my mind
>   - with 后面接从句

Adamson walked over and rubbed his hand across a panel. "This is English oak, isn't it? A little different texture from Italian oak."

> - Adamson walked over and rubbed his hand across a panel.
>   - 这个句子中有三个动词，walked over / rubbed / across

"Yes," Eastman replied. "Imported English oak. It was selected for me by a friend who specializes in fine woods."

> - It was selected for me by a friend who specializes in fine woods."
>   - for / by / who / in 一个句子中用了四个来修饰

Then Eastman showed him about the room, commenting on the proportions, the coloring, the hand carving and other effects he had helped to plan and execute.

> - other effects he had helped to plan and execute.	
>   - 断句是 other effects he had helped 然后再是 to plan and execute. 

While drifting about the room, admiring the woodwork, they paused before a window, and George Eastman, in his modest, soft-spoken way, pointed out some of the institutions through which he was trying to help humanity: the University of Rochester, the General Hospital, the Homeopathic Hospital, the Friendly Home, the Children's Hospital. Mr. Adamson congratulated him warmly on the idealistic way he was using his wealth to alleviate the sufferings of humanity. Presently, George Eastman unlocked a glass case and pulled out the first camera he had ever owned — an invention he had bought from an Englishman.

> - While 开头的句子，就一定是个组合句，而且主语也就是重点，在后面，和 athough 这种差不多
>   - While I'm eating , I head a loud noise 
>   - 所以这类句子都是过去式，在 while后是当时正在进行的动作，所以是正在进行时，而 后面的主语需要是过去式，需要去看一下复合句
>   - 在《英语魔法师之语法俱乐部》的第二篇第十三章 副词从句(P257) 中看到了 while 是副词从句 中的让步 从句
>     - While the disease is not fatal, it can be very dangerous 
>     - 上面这个例子是让步，但是本文中的 while 不是让步啊，是表示同时进行的
>   - 从网上搜了一下[while 用法](http://en-grammar.xiao84.com/201612/27639.html)，while 用作连词时  **意为“当……时候，和……同时”，引导时间状语从句** 
>     - While I was watching TV, the bell rang 
>     - 所以上文中的 while 是引导时间状语从句
> - pointed out some of the institutions through which he was trying to help humanity:
>   - 这里的 which 引导的是一个定语从句，通常用来修饰前面的一个词或者一个句子
>     - She accepted his proposal, as(which)was natural.
>   - 可以看《新编英语阅读手册》中的 which 的用法和判断（ P326），在which 作关系代词用，都是代替某个词或者词组，并对它进行补充说明
> - George Eastman unlocked a glass case and pulled out the first camera he had ever owned — an invention he had bought from an Englishman.
>   - 这本书中有非常多的这种例子，就是后面接一堆的修饰或者补充前面的名词或者主语
>     - 如上文中的 he had ever owned / an invention he had bought /  from an Englishman.

Adamson questioned him at length about his early struggles to get started in business, and Mr. Eastman spoke with real feeling about the poverty of his childhood, telling how his widowed mother had kept a boardinghouse while he clerked in an insurance office. The terror of poverty haunted him day and night, and he resolved to make enough money so that his mother wouldn't have to work. Mr. Adamson drew him out with further questions and listened, absorbed, while he related the story of his experiments with dry photographic plates. He told how he had worked in an office all day, and sometimes experimented all night, taking only brief naps while the chemicals were working, sometimes working and sleeping in his clothes for seventy-two hours at a stretch.

James Adamson had been ushered into Eastman's office at ten-fifteen and had been warned that he must not take more than five minutes; but an hour had passed, then two hours passed. And they were still talking.

Finally, George Eastman turned to Adamson and said, "The last time I was in Japan I bought some chairs, brought them home, and put them in my sun porch. But the sun peeled the paint, so I went downtown the other day and bought some paint and painted the chairs myself. Would you like to see what sort of a job I can do painting chairs? All right. Come up to my home and have lunch with me and I'll show you."

After lunch, Mr. Eastman showed Adamson the chairs he had brought from Japan. They weren't worth more than a few dollars, but George Eastman, now a multimillionaire, was proud of them because he himself had painted them.

The order for the seats amounted to $90,000. Who do you suppose got the order — James Adamson or one of his competitors?

> - The order for the seats amounted to $90,000
>   - for 到底是个什么意思？修饰前面的 order?
> - Who do you suppose got the order
>   - do you suppose 用来修饰 who ，是个短语

M. Marais reported: "I was very surprised and, even more, disappointed, because I was under the impression that I had been fair to her and receptive to her needs. Inasmuch as she was a friend as well as an employee, I probably had taken her too much for granted and maybe was even more demanding of her than of other employees.

> 

"I could not, of course, accept this resignation without some explanation. I took her aside and said, 'Paulette, you must understand that I cannot accept your resignation. You mean a great deal to me and to this company, and you are as important to the success of this restaurant as I am.' I repeated this in front of the entire staff, and I invited her to my home and reiterated my confidence in her with my family present.

"Paulette withdrew her resignation, and today I can rely on her as never before. I frequently reinforce this by expressing my appreciation for what she does and showing her how important she is to me and to the restaurant."

"Talk to people about themselves," said Disraeli, one of the shrewdest men who ever ruled the British Empire, and they will listen for hours."
